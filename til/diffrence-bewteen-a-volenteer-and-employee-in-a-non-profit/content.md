## Preface
When operating RathHacks, I have found myself often forgetting the differences between an employee or a volunteer. As I realize as my organization grows, as my events grow it will be important that I harden the distinction. I was referred to an article yesterday about the difference from the Non-Profit Risk Management Center, by Melanie Lockwood Herman. After reading the article twice over, I found out there is more to the differences of employee vs volunteer than just who gets a paycheck, turning out to be a dichotomy. I am glad I gave this a read, as it might save my ass in the future.

## Key Differences
| Aspect | Employee | Volunteer |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Compensation** | Receives **regular pay, wages, or salary**; payments are generally treated as taxable income subject to withholding. | **Unpaid**; may receive **reimbursement for expenses** or **"nominal" fees** that are not tied to productivity or hours worked. |
| **Expectations & Schedule** | Typically a **full-time occupation** involving a consistent, fixed number of hours on a regular basis. | Work is usually **seasonal, "as needed,"** or for specific programs; performed for **civic, charitable, or humanitarian reasons**. |
| **Documentation & Policy** | Governed by an **Employee Handbook**; requires a written job description including **classification status** (e.g., exempt vs. non-exempt). | Governed by a separate **Volunteer Handbook**; uses **Volunteer Agreements** to clarify that no compensation is expected. |
| **Legal Status** | Protected by the **Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)** and **Title VII** anti-discrimination laws. | Generally exempt from FLSA; protected by the **Volunteer Protection Act (VPA)** unless they receive value exceeding **$500 per year**. |

## Risk
When you manage the distinction between employees and volunteers, it is something not to be taken lightly. A simple misclassification can lead to significant legal and financial liabilities for you and your members. Thankfully, the article listed some tips for avoiding the risk altogether.

#### Wage and Hour Claims:
If an individual is improperly classified as a volunteer when they should be an employee, the organization may face expensive claims for unpaid minimum wages and overtime penalties under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).

#### Loss of Volunteer Protection: 
Under the Volunteer Protection Act (VPA), volunteers are generally shielded from certain liabilities. however, if a volunteer receives compensation or benefits exceeding $500 per year, they lose the aforementioned federal legal protection.

#### Taxation and Withholding Liability: 
Non-profits are generally required to treat payments like stipends or living allowances as taxable wages, meaning they must withhold income tax and FICA contributions. Failure to do so can result in penalties from tax authorities.

#### Expansion of Legal Protections: 
Converting a volunteer to employee status inadvertently extends various legal protections to them, such as protection from illegal discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

#### Coercion Disputes: 
Non-profits often face high risk when employees feel "undue pressure" to volunteer their time. Any perception of coercion to work "off the clock" (volunteer) is a "wage and hour claim waiting to happen"
